# 🤖 Machine Learning Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of **machine learning projects** that I am working on.  
Each project focuses on **real-world applications** and uses Python-based ML frameworks to implement models, visualize results, and evaluate performance.  

The projects cover a variety of domains such as **sports predictions, financial forecasting, computer vision, and data analysis**, and are continuously updated as I explore new techniques and libraries.

## 📂 Projects Overview

### 1. 🏏 T20 Tournament Prediction using XGBoost
- Predicts winners of group stage, Super 4, and final matches in T20 tournaments (Asia Cup-style).  
- Uses historical T20I match data from [Cricsheet](https://cricsheet.org/).  
- Features include **team statistics extraction, XGBoost training, tournament simulation**, and **visualizations**.  
- Folder: `Asian_Cup_2025_Predictions/`

### 2. 💹 NVIDIA Stock Analysis & Next-Day Prediction (NVDA)
- Builds a **multi-model ensemble AI system** to forecast **NVIDIA (NVDA)** next-day stock prices.  
- Combines statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models for robust forecasting.  
- Key models used: **ARIMA-GARCH**, **XGBoost**, **LSTM-GRU Attention**, and **Monte Carlo Simulation**.  
- Produces **confidence intervals, volatility forecasts, risk metrics, and trading recommendations**.  
- Folder: `Stock_Analysis_NVDA/`

#### Example Output:
| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| **Current Price** | \$183.16 |
| **Predicted Next-Day Price** | \$186.58 (+1.87%) |
| **Confidence Interval (95%)** | [\$182.07, \$184.05] |
| **Recommendation** | 🟢 **BUY** |

> ⚡ Each project has its own **folder, scripts, datasets, trained models**, and dedicated `README.md` describing its workflow, architecture, and results.

## 🚀 Workflow

1. Collect or load datasets (CSV, JSON, or API-based financial data).  
2. Preprocess and clean the data, handle missing values, and engineer new features.  
3. Train models using **supervised**, **unsupervised**, or **hybrid AI** approaches.  
4. Evaluate models with metrics like **Accuracy**, **RMSE**, **Sharpe Ratio**, or **F1-score**.  
5. Visualize predictions and analyze feature importance and performance metrics.  
6. Export results, charts, and reports for future analysis or deployment.
